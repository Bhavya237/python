Project Description
This project is created for AtliQ Hotels to address 10 ad-hoc requests from the management, aiming to gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. 
The analysis covers various aspects of hotel occupancy and revenue across different cities and room categories etc.

Ad-Hoc Requests
Average occupancy rate in each of the room categories:

Analyzed the occupancy rates for each room category to understand their performance.
Average occupancy rate per city:

Calculated the average occupancy rates for each city to identify high and low-demand areas.
Better occupancy, Weekday or Weekend:

Compared occupancy rates between weekdays and weekends to determine the peak periods.
Occupancy for different cities in the month of June:

Examined the occupancy rates for various cities specifically in the month of June.
Append new data with existing data in the month of August:

Integrated new data from August with the existing dataset for a comprehensive analysis.
Print revenue realized per city:

Calculated the total revenue generated in each city.
Print month by month revenue:
